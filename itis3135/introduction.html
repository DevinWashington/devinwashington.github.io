    <h3>Courses I'm Taking and Why</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ITIS 3135 Web Based Application Design and Development - I don’t have any experience with HTML or web design so, I figured this would be a good class to learn about it. 
        </li>
        <li>ITSC 3688 Computers and Their Impact on Society - Required
        </li>
        <li>ITIS 4360 Human-Centered AI - Matches with my HCI concentration, and AI seems to be the future so I was interested. 
        </li>
        <li>PSYC 2131 Intro to Forensic Psychology- I am interested in law, so this is a good class to take for my Psychology minor. 
        </li>
        <li>PSYC 2130 Intro to Social Psychology - Required for my Psychology minor
        </li>
        <li>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I am a big car guy and I can play multiple instruments, including the drums and marimba. I also dabble in music production in my free time.
