                <h3>FL Studio21</h3>
                <p>I mainly use <a href="https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/" target="_blank">Fl Studio</a> when it comes to making beats. It is a program for entry-level producers, but its power should not be underestimated today. Most mainstream trap beats are made using this software, and the possibilites are truly endless when you learn it.</p>

                <h3>Ableton</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/" target="_blank">Ableton</a> is a DAW that I don't have as much experience in, but it's power cannot be underestimated. I find Ableton to be especially useful when I am wokring with genres outsite of trap, as it allows for a lot more experimentation.
                    It is not as user-friendly as FL Studio, but it is a great tool for those who are willing to learn it.</p>

                <h3>HalfTime</h3>
                <p><a href="https://www.cableguys.com/halftime" target="_blank">HalfTime</a> is a plugin that I use daily, and it helps me create melodies when I am lacking inspiration. It can be put on any mixer track, and it will half the tempo of the audio for that track. I especially like this plugin becuase you are able to cut certain frequencies from being processed, which allows for a lot of those muddier, lower frequences to be bypassed.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.airmusictech.com/virtual-instruments/xpand-2/" target="_blank">Xpand!2</a> is a plugin I have only recently started incorpororating more into my workflow, but it has already become one of my favorite generator plugins. The ability to layer 4 sounds in one instance of Xpand is its best feature, and its stock sounds/effects are really all you need to make whatever genre of music you want.</p>

It is not best interface on the market, it is also is not the most expensive. This, or the more popular FocusRite are great options for new producers, or even just as a small portable interface I can travel with. </p>
